'''
How do you improve query performance from your initial query?

We created appropriate indexes on the columns used in WHERE clauses, JOIN conditions, and GROUP BY statements.
We used CTEs (Common Table Expressions) to improve readability and potentially help the query planner optimize the queries.
For text searches, we used GIN indexes to speed up LIKE operations.
We structured the queries to minimize the amount of data processed, using subqueries and joins efficiently.


Where did you create new indexes?

We created indexes on year columns for temporal queries.
We added compound indexes on (booktitle, year) for conference-related queries.
We created GIN indexes on title columns for text search operations.
We added indexes on author columns to speed up author-based aggregations.


What was the impact of new index creation in terms of query cost and performance?

The exact impact would need to be measured using EXPLAIN ANALYZE on your specific dataset. However, you can expect:

Significant reduction in full table scans, replaced by index scans or bitmap index scans.
Reduced I/O operations, especially for queries with selective WHERE clauses.
Faster JOIN operations when using indexed columns.
Improved performance in text search operations using GIN indexes.


BONUS: What was the effect of cache on each querys performance?

To measure cache effects, run each query twice and compare the execution times:

First run: Data is read from disk, likely slower.
Second run: Data may be cached in memory, potentially much faster.


Use EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS) to see detailed buffer usage information.
Queries that process large amounts of data (like the decade aggregations) may show significant cache benefits on subsequent runs.
Smaller, more focused queries (like finding specific authors) might show less dramatic cache effects.
